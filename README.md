Initial Publish Date: Aprial 06th, 2018

The purpose of repo is for sharing code at commercial level which can be adopted into your business environment instantly without much effort. While third party tools like Ansible, Terraform and alike tastes good as sugar, their limitation in terms of supporting public cloud Infrastructure, and lack of documentation to tell you their limitation, has destroyed many lovely weekends of many DevOps Engineers and Software Developers. Hence, here comes this project.

Code in this repo is purely clear text file based. You will meet programs written in Python and Javascripts, scripts written in bash, and ARM templates in JSON format. There is no SECRET, nothing is hidden away from you. Code here is not just code, they are self sufficient tools for addressing computer engineers' daily work, and for helping business development. They can be run from your local computer's terminal, and they can be easily integrated into your CI/CD tools like Jenkins or Bamboo, or even into your own programs. Code here is free to public access, and it can be used in your commercial environment freely.
